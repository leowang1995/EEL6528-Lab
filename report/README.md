# General guidelines for writing a lab report

- $\color{magenta}{\textbf{You should put all your report material in this directory!}}$
- $\color{magenta}{\textbf{Your report should be written in GitHub markdown. The main file of the report should be named}}$ `report.md`.
  
  See [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) to learn about how to write in GitHub.
- Your lab report may include the following sections:
  1. **Introduction**: Talk about what you are to do in the lab.
  2. **Solution approach**: Describe the algorithms and techniques that you employ to solve the lab problem(s). You may skip this if the algorithms and techniques are just trivial.
  3. **Implementation**: Describe your software design, i.e., your C++ design. How many threads, which thread does what, etc?
  4. **Results**: Report your results, e.g., printout, screen capture, plots, etc.
  5. **Code listing**: List all your code. Please comment your code as much as you can. You may simply put up links in your `report.md` to link to the source code in the `src` directory.

- I do not expect a very elaborate report. In fact, I'd like your report to be as concise as possible while not skipping important details to allow me to understand what you're trying to do.
