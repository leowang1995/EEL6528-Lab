## Lab Questions

### Question 2: Sampling Rate Testing
Test the system with different sampling rates and observe performance:
- 1 MHz: Should work fine
- 5 MHz: May see higher CPU usage
- 10 MHz: Likely to see overflows
- 20 MHz: Expect many overflows
- 25 MHz: Maximum for Gigabit Ethernet

### Question 3: Thread Scaling
Test with different numbers of processing threads:
- 1 thread: Baseline performance
- 2 threads: Improved throughput
- 4 threads: Further improvements
- 8 threads: May show diminishing returns

## Expected Deliverables
- Performance analysis
- CPU usage measurements
- Overflow behavior observations
- Thread scaling analysis
- Conclusions and recommendations
